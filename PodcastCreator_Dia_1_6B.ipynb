            "[S1]  Hey, did you catch that NetApp video about AI and data infrastructure? It got me thinking about how much pressure AI is putting on traditional storage.\n",
            "[S2]  Totally. Tom Shields kicked it off by saying exactly that – AI data pipelines are really straining storage architectures because the workloads are constantly evolving.\n",
            "Generating segment 2\n",
            "[S1]  Right, and Krish brought up the performance demands. (inhales) Especially for those big training models, they need *super* high performance, like superpod level.\n",
            "[S2]  Yeah, but the key thing he mentioned, which I thought was smart, is needing that performance over standard protocols like NFS or S3, using the Ethernet IT teams already have. No weird, proprietary stuff.\n",
            "Generating segment 3\n",
            "[S1]  That makes sense for adoption. Plus, the need to scale storage, compute, and networking independently – you don't always need more of everything at the same time.\n",
            "[S2]  Exactly. And Russell's point about real-world constraints really hit home. (clears throat) It's not just about performance; it has to fit in existing data centers. That means density and energy efficiency are huge.\n",
            "Generating segment 4\n",
            "[S1]  And it shouldn't be this separate AI silo, right? It needs to be managed alongside everything else, using existing IT skills and tools.\n",
            "[S2]  For sure. We're moving past AI just being a proof-of-concept. Now it's going into production, tied to real business processes. It has to be reliable and manageable. (sighs) Someone's going to get called at 2 AM if it breaks!\n",
            "Generating segment 5\n",
            "[S1]  (laughs) True! That brings up the whole hybrid and multi-cloud thing. Data's everywhere – on-prem, in different clouds. Moving it needs to be seamless.\n",
            "[S2]  Krish called it defying 'data gravity' and breaking silos. You need that consistent view, that common data plane and control plane across everything, on-prem and cloud.\n",
            "Generating segment 6\n",
            "[S1]  And it needs to work with *multiple* clouds, right? Because maybe the best GPUs are in one cloud, but your data or other tools are somewhere else.\n",
            "[S2]  Yeah, Russell mentioned being pragmatic, not dogmatic about being \"all-in\" on cloud or all on-prem. Use the best tool for the job, wherever it is.\n",
            "Generating segment 7\n",
            "[S1]  It really sounds like flexibility and having that unified experience across on-prem and cloud is the name of the game for AI-ready infrastructure.\n",
            "[S2]  Absolutely. It's about making it manageable for IT Ops today, but also being ready for whatever crazy AI developments come next month. (laughs)\n",
