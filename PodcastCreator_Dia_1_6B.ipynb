            "Generating segment 1\n",
            "[S1]  Hey, did you see that NetApp video about AI and data infrastructure? It's clear AI is really shaking things up for storage.\n",
            "[S2]  Totally. Tom Shields kicked it off talking about the pressure AI data pipelines put on traditional storage. It's not just about capacity anymore.\n",
            "Generating segment 2\n",
            "[S1]  Right, and Krish Vitaldevara dove into what 'AI-ready' really means. Especially for those massive training workloads.\n",
            "[S2]  He said they need *super* high performance, like SuperPOD level, but here's the kicker – delivered over standard protocols IT already uses.\n",
            "Generating segment 3\n",
            "[S1]  Yeah, like PNFS and S3 over standard Ethernet. No need to rip and replace everything or learn totally new ways of doing things. (clears throat) That makes adoption way easier for IT Ops.\n",
            "[S2]  And the need to scale storage, compute, and networking independently! That allows for better resource utilization.\n",
            "Generating segment 4\n",
            "[S1]  Then Russell Fishman made a great point – fundamentally, AI is just another workload, albeit a demanding one.\n",
            "[S2]  (laughs) Exactly! It shouldn't be this isolated, complex beast. It needs to integrate with existing operations and management practices.\n",
            "Generating segment 5\n",
            "[S1]  And physically integrate too! Krish mentioned you can't just build new AI-specific data centers overnight.\n",
            "[S2]  So the infrastructure needs to be super dense and energy efficient to actually run these power-hungry AI workloads within existing data center footprints.\n",
            "Generating segment 6\n",
            "[S1]  It's that shift from experimental POCs to real-world production AI. Suddenly, cost, governance, existing skills, and those physical constraints become critical.\n",
            "[S2]  And that ties into the hybrid and multi-cloud reality, doesn't it? Data isn't just on-prem anymore.\n",
            "Generating segment 7\n",
            "[S1]  Definitely. Moving data between on-prem and cloud needs to be seamless to avoid that 'data gravity' problem. The cloud infrastructure should feel almost native to the on-prem setup.\n",
            "[S2]  You need consistency across the board. And the flexibility to use different clouds, maybe grabbing specific GPUs from one, or toolkits from another.\n",
            "Generating segment 8\n",
            "[S1]  So, it's not about being all-in on cloud or stubbornly on-prem. It's about a pragmatic balance, as Russell put it.\n",
            "[S2]  (sighs) It means IT needs a consistent, holistic view of their entire environment – infrastructure, data plane, control plane – across both worlds.\n",
            "Generating segment 9\n",
            "[S1]  Because AI workloads absolutely demand that level of integration and flexibility.\n",
            "[S2]  So, laying that flexible, future-ready foundation is step one for any enterprise serious about production AI.\n",
