        "[S1] So I watched this NetApp video about data infrastructure for AI, and it really highlights how demanding these new workloads are.\n",
        "[S2] Yeah, they mentioned AI data pipelines are putting serious pressure on storage architectures, right? The requirements are constantly evolving.\n",
        "[S1] Exactly. Especially for things like AI model training, which needs absolutely massive performance.\n",
        "[S2] And Krish made a great point – it’s not just raw performance, but getting that performance over standard, familiar protocols like NFS or S3, using the Ethernet networks IT teams already have. (clears throat) No need to rip and replace everything.\n",
        "[S1] That makes sense. Plus, the need for flexibility. The infrastructure has to handle these huge training jobs but also scale efficiently for inference later on.\n",
        "[S2] And scale *independently*! They talked about scaling storage, compute, and networking separately to really maximise how resources are used.\n",
        "[S1] That ties into what Russell was saying too, about fitting AI into the *existing* data center. (laughs) You can't just build new ones overnight.\n",
        "[S2] Right! So the underlying storage needs to be super dense and energy-efficient to work within current power and space limits. It has to integrate, not be its own isolated thing.\n",
        "[S1] It sounds like IT Ops needs solutions that work with their current tools and skills, rather than something completely alien. AI is becoming just another workload, albeit a demanding one.\n",
        "[S2] Absolutely. And it's often hybrid – data and tools might be on-prem *and* in the cloud, maybe even multiple clouds.\n",
        "[S1] So you need that seamless experience, right? Moving data easily, managing it consistently wherever it lives, breaking down those silos.\n",
        "[S2] Yeah, defying \"data gravity\" as Krish put it. You need that consistent view and operation across your whole environment, on-prem and cloud(s).\n",
        "[S1] It's really moving beyond just playing around with AI in a lab, isn't it? This is about running it in production, integrated with real business processes.\n",
        "[S2] Totally. That means it needs to be reliable, manageable, automatable – all the things you expect from production infrastructure. The days of just POCs are evolving fast.\n",
        "[S1] So the key takeaway seems to be needing a really flexible, high-performance, but operationally practical data infrastructure that spans wherever AI workloads run.\n",
        "[S2] Definitely. It needs to be ready for today's AI demands and whatever comes next, without forcing IT teams to start from scratch.\n",
